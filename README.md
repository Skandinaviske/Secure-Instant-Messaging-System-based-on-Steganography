# Secure-Instant-Messaging-System-based-on-Steganography
This is a instant messaging system based on LSB steganography and camouflage. You can hide your secret messages in images and send them to ours.
1.Instant messaging
While establishing the instant messaging platform,Our team chose the solutions of Tencent cloud communication.
we established instant messaging platform and improved some basic functions by updating the original DEMO of Tencent cloud.

2.Gesture recognition technology
The project used the gesture recognition technology.
Only while users properly set right gesture patterns in a specific area in advance, they can turn on the steganographic management functions provided by our application platform.

3.Hiding technology of volume key sequence
Users can set the password sequences of the volume keys,in the case of application icon hidden. Through users continuously press specific volume key to start the application.

4.LeastSignificant Bits
Our application based on stable and reliable LSB(LeastSignificant Bits) algorithm, providing users with secret channel in picture carrier. 
It ensures that those hidden information will not be found bu attackers in the process of information transfer.
The LSB Demo referes to https://github.com/paspao/MobiStego. Thanks his demo.
